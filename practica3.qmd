## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

\`\`\`{r}x = seq(1, 10, 1) \# como range de python, el step puede ser float}

dom = seq(-1, 23, l = 1000) ...

\`\`\`

\$\\sum(i=1)\^n X_i
